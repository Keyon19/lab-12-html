For the home page of my website, maybe it would be a good idea for me to introduce myself. Not introduce myself in full as that should be for
the "about me" page. But rather a introduction into my website and what's in it. Having a banner and/or some artwork would also be appealing
cause it can catch the viewers attention. The home page is the first page that they will see so it need to pop out. By having bold colors it
could stand out more and catch the viewers' attention. My favorite color is green so I would probably use green in some form in my css file for this
website. Since it is the home page, it should also be easy to navigate. I should make sure that the home page is easy to navigate by having the tabs
to the other pages on top so that the viewer can't miss it.
