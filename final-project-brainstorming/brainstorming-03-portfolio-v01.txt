For the portfolio page I would have pictures of projects that I have created throughout my time in high school and
in college. With those pictures I will have a description of what the project is and what it can do. The picture of the
projects would include the step by step process of each process. The projects would also be ordered by the year they were
completed to show the progress I have made throughout time. The portfolio page would also be very stylish by not over the
top cause I want the viewer to see the pictures and the content provided on the page. The portfolio page might be separated into categories
so it would be easier for the viewer to understand and navigate the page.
